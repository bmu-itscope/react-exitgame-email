# Email Client build for an Exit Game puzzle
The Email Client Stub provided in this project consists of a login screen accepting no login data.

The user must then navigate to the `Forgot password` screen and enter some personal data which he can find at the exit game location.

After entering the right personal data on the `Forgot password` screen the user is redirected to the email client and can view the emails.

# Instructions
To start development, run in terminal:

`npm install`, afterthat run `npm run dev`

To run in production mode, run
`npm run build` and then `npm run server`
